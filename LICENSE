The project is developed within the framework of the course "Software Engineering" in the 3rd
semester at the Aachen University of Applied Sciences. It is not allowed to use this project in any
way in its current state. The rights of the software are solely held by the members of the SWE
Group E4 in the winter semester 19/20 at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Information
Technology of the University of Applied Sciences Aachen. A future license can replace this license
and make it ineffective. Should individual provisions of this contract be invalid or unenforceable
or become invalid or unenforceable after conclusion of the contract, this shall not affect the
validity of the remainder of the contract. The invalid or unenforceable provision shall be replaced
by a valid and enforceable provision whose effects come as close as possible to the economic
objective pursued by the contracting parties with the invalid or unenforceable provision. The above
provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis in the event that the contract proves to be incomplete.
